# dc2_misc

This contains miscellaneous codes to create simulation products, including DC2 codes

Directories:

- Pixelize halo lightcones:
  This divides halo lightcones into pixel files, assuming SOD and FOF properties are within the file
  (this code was used for the full octant run of DC2 - similar code omitting SOD properties was used for the 440 square degree run)
